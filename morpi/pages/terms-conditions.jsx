                            If your card is declined, you will receive an error message. No payment will be charged to your card and no order is processed. There may be a pending transaction on your account until your card-issuing bank withdrawal authorization. This usually takes 2-5 business days. Your card may be declined for a number of reasons, including insufficient funds, AVS (Address Verification System) mismatch, or entering the wrong security code.

                            If your payment is declined, you will need to provide an alternative payment method or provide another card to which the payment can be loaded and processed.
